# Applications and Advantages of Linear Algebra in Neural Networks

Our main investigation was on applying concepts of neural networks to linear algebra when linear algebra is used in neural networks, to investigate this it was extremely important for us to justify that linear algebra is used in neural networks, for this we divide our project into two major parts. One part justifies the use of linear algebra in neural networks and the second part applies concepts of neural networks to linear algebra to give better solutions. This could be done by using the stationary iterative methods to solve a system of linear equations.

**There are basically four main methods of stationary iterative methods**,

i) Jacobi Iterative Method
ii) Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method
iii) Successive Overrelaxation (SOR)
iv) Symmetric Successive Overrelaxation (SSOR)

**But we focused on**,

i) Jacobi Iterative Method
ii) Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method
